  <p> As the holiday season draws nearer and nearer, we can all find a few things that we wish for. Listed here are a few things that I hope for.</p>
  <h2> Presents and Gifts</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Posters</li>
    <li>Various Books</li>
    <li>Maybe a Cat</li>
    <li>Clothing</li>
  </ul>
 <p> However, the holiday season is not all about reciving gifts, no matter how amazing it seems. Holidays are about family and being sure to spend as much time as possible with them.</p>
  <h2> Best Things to do on the Holidays</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> Eat</li>
    <li>Spend time with Family</li>
    <li> Eat a bit More</li>
